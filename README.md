## Simple Coordinate Plot

### Overview
This repo contains a rudimentary coordinate plotter app, created using Android composables.
- This was homework for the first 2 weeks of the Kodeco Android Bootcamp Jan-May 2024

### Implementation details
- Contains a simple splash screen (displays a label for 2s) 
- Contains an imported drawable (from a .png) used for the plot's point. 
- The app transitions from the slash screen to the PlotSurface (made up of a Map composable that uses 2 MapSlider composables). 
- Each MapSlider reflects the current slider value as a % and immediately updates the plot point during interaction.
